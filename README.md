# Geometry-Programs

The "WhenIGetBoredInGeometry.py" program is one file that contains the code of many other individual files

The "law of cosines.py" is the individual program that I use to debug that function

The "law of cosines.py" currently contains bugs in the input section, however
the actual data manipulation does work.
